# Requirements Extract (From Project Brief Images)

Date: 2026-02-05

## 1. Background
- Spinney Hill delivers support services including drug and alcohol recovery, spiritual counselling, education and outreach, family support, food bank referrals, and community advice.
- Current operations are largely paper-based and disconnected, creating challenges for coordination, data capture, safeguarding, reporting, and long‑term follow‑up.
- A single integrated CRM is required to unite teams, enquiries, partners, and supporters into a secure shared platform.

## 2. Project Aim
Develop a secure, role‑based CRM system that:
- Centralises all enquiries and service user records.
- Enables teams to collaborate around each individual.
- Improves referrals, appointments, and follow‑up.
- Captures meaningful data for learning, reporting, and funding.
- Strengthens long‑term recovery and community impact.

The CRM should become the digital backbone of Spinney Hill.

## 3. Key Users
- Telephone / Frontline Enquiry Team
- Assessment Team
- Drug & Alcohol Workers
- Spiritual Counselling Team
- Education & Outreach Team
- Telephone Aftercare / Check‑In Team
- Management & Safeguarding Leads
- Admin & Fundraising Team

## 4. Enquiry Management (Front Door)
The CRM must log all incoming enquiries (especially telephone calls) under clear categories, including:
- Family members seeking advice or guidance
- Individuals seeking help for themselves
- School / Madrassa enquiries for seminars or workshops
- Donation offers (money, food, goods)
- Food bank support
- Domestic issues
- Mental health concerns
- General community support

For each enquiry, capture:
- Caller details
- Reason for contact
- Risk or safeguarding flags
- Advice given or action taken
- Referral made (internal or external)
- Staff member handling the enquiry
- Date and time

All enquiries must be stored for data analysis, reporting, and research.

## 5. Service User Registration & Case Management
When an enquiry becomes a client, the CRM should:
- Digitally register the service user
- Create a single client record
- Capture consent and GDPR status
- Record presenting issues and risks

Each service user record acts as a shared case file for relevant teams.

## 6. Appointments & Diary Management
The CRM must include shared diaries that allow:
- Telephone team to book appointments directly
- Appointments for:
  - Assessments
  - Drug & alcohol workers
  - Spiritual counselling

Bookings should trigger:
- Internal notifications
- Email confirmations (Phase 1)

## 7. Multi‑Team Notes & Collaboration
All teams working with a service user should be able to:
- Add case notes
- View relevant notes from other teams

Notes should be:
- Time‑stamped
- Linked to the author
- Categorised by service type

Sensitive notes (e.g., safeguarding, spiritual counselling) must have restricted access.

## 8. Telephone Check‑In & Aftercare
The CRM should support ongoing recovery and aftercare by:
- Giving telephone support staff access to:
  - Contact details of current and past service users
  - Engagement history
- Allowing staff to log:
